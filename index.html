    Hello World! My name is Tao Yang and this is my website. 
    I document my on going journey here. That might include my resume, portfolio, writing, music and all forms of media. 
    But more importantly, this is the documentation of my quest of understanding and living the true meaning of &ldquo;Tao&rdquo;
    Just like the beginning of Tao Te Ching stated: &ldquo;The way (Tao) that can be explained is not the Unchanging way (Tao).&rdquo;.
    Therefore, the quest is, and will always be, ongoing.
    And if Yuanfen brought us together here, I hope we can stay in touch and you can find something useful here to bring along in your personal journey.

        My name is Tao Yang and this is my website.
        I document my on going journey here. That might include my resume, portfolio, writing, music and all forms of
        media.
        But more importantly, this is the documentation of my quest of understanding and living the true meaning of
        &ldquo;Tao&rdquo;
        Just like the beginning of Tao Te Ching stated: &ldquo;The way (Tao) that can be explained is not the Unchanging
        way (Tao).&rdquo;.
        Therefore, the quest is, and will always be, ongoing.
        And if Yuanfen brought us together here, I hope we can stay in touch and you can find something useful here to
        bring along in your personal journey.
